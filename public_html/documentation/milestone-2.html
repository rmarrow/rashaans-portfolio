<h1> Welcome </h1>

<p>It will be one or two sentences long. Saying hello and stating I am a Full Stack Web Developer. I will add a picture of me. </p>

<h2> About Me </h2>

<p>This section will tell others who I am! As well as what I can do! I will mention all of my development skills and what I have done and currently doing. I will mention my interests and things I am a good fit for.</p>

<h3> Portfolio </h3>

<p> This section will have a big header and a few slides of the projects I have completed and a detailed section below it to let others know that there are more projects to be posted in the near future! </p>

<h4> Connect With Me </h4>

<p> This section will have three buttons. Those buttons will be three different ways I can be contacted and allow others to go straight to my pages when they click them. They will be linked to the buttons. </p>
